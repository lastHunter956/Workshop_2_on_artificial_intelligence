    "# Treasure Hunt in the Ancient Jungle\n",
    "You are an intrepid treasure hunter in search of a legendary relic lost deep in an ancient jungle. You have a rudimentary map that indicates a series of landmarks in the jungle, but it is unclear how they are connected. You must use your programming expertise and problem-solving skills to create an algorithm that generates a search tree and finds the shortest path to the lost treasure.\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "You will proceed to create an agent that can use artificial intelligence to find the shortest path to the lost treasure in the ancient jungle, using a search algorithm.\n",
    "### Step 1: Map representation\n",
    "To begin, we need to represent the rudimentary map as a graph. Each reference point will be a node, and the connections between them will be the edges of the graph. We will use coordinates to locate these nodes in 2D space.\n",
    "### Step 2: Search algorithm\n",
    "We will use a search algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting point to the treasure. Since we are looking for a path in a graph, **is an appropriate choice. A^** uses a **heuristic function** to estimate the cost of reaching the goal from a given node and then selects the next node to expand based on a combination of these estimated costs and the actual costs travelled.\n",
    "### Step 3: Implementing the intelligent agent\n",
    "#### The necessary imports are performed\n",
    "In this case only the \"heapq\" library will be imported, which is a standard Python library that provides the heapq library, which is mainly used to implement heap data structures. A heap is a specialised data structure that allows efficient access to the minimum (minimum heap) or maximum (maximum heap) element in a dataset.\n"
